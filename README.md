# LaTeX-Template
Shun's LaTeX template kept as up to date as possible

Here, I have attached my commonly used imports which I call in my LaTeX files, titled `shun4cmds.tex`, `shun4colors.tex`, and `shun4imports.tex`. If you want to modify my LaTeX files for your own note taking benefit, feel free to do so and credit me. Make sure you download my imports as well.

## Color Schemes
It is not a secret I like the [Pink/Purple/Blue color scheme](https://github.com/shun4midx/Pink-Purple-Blue-VSCode-Theme). As a result, my more recent LaTeX files for notes all follow this aesthetic, typically with **blue boxes for headings**, **purple boxes for subheadings**, and **pink boxes for important concepts**. I also typically use yellow highlighter and very rarely green if there is too much yellow. 

If for some reason you do not like this color scheme, all boxes and highlights of non-coding parts are drawn via commands in `shun4colors.tex` and light blue boxes with code are drawn via commands in `shun4cmds.tex`, so feel free to clone this repo and modify the colors in the commands yourself for personal use. On the other hand, if for some reason you like the color scheme I use, feel free to use my usual import files for personal use.

## Attached Template
In `writeup.tex`, I have a very simple template of how to use my imported files' most commonly used capabilities outside of normal LaTeX. When rendered, it looks like `writeup.pdf`.

## Documentation
It should be clear from reading the files directly, but I will update this later if anything is unclear
