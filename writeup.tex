\begin{itemize}
  \item Typing the whole command for a backslash is annoying so I can just type \texttt{\bs bs} for a \bs
  \item Actually, I can \hl{highlight text} with \texttt{\bs hl} --- better yet, I can \hlbf{bold the highlighted text} with \texttt{\bs hlbf}, or I can \hlit{italicize the highlighted text} with \texttt{\bs hlit}.
  \item I can even \ghl{highlight the text in green} with \texttt{\bs ghl}
  \item Otherwise I can just \textbf{bold stuff} or \textit{italicize stuff} or \textbf{\textit{do both}}.
  \item If I want to \boxtxt{box my answer that is in plain text}, I can do that with \texttt{\bs boxtxt}, or I can box math with standard \LaTeX to type one of my favorite time complexities: $\boxed{O(\alpha^\star(n))}$.

\newchap{This is a chapter header (The box will be empty)}

\noindent You can also cite stuff \cite{gt85} that will pop up in your bibliography in your PDF if you include all your references in BibTeX in \texttt{references.bib}. Below, you can see how it looks like when cited, because oh how much I love \cite{gt85}. \\
